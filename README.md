# Wellmatic (Water Well Schematic Planner)
- Built a Python program to create schematics of water well systems depending on size for a hydrogeologist consulting firm
-	Implemented option to export individual water well data and schematic plan to Excel and Notepad using File I/O 
-	Key Feature: Allow user to include drawdown values (flow rate, transitivity, aquifer storage coefficient) for each well individually
- Note: Mathematical aspect of code was based off of drawdown formulas provided to me
